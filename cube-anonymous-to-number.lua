  If we are performing call blocking based on calling number, and we receive
  an INVITE from anonymous, it will be blocked because, CUCM will not be able
  to use our blank nor ! XLATEs to permit calls.

  Therefore, we are going to find and replace these anonymous caller IDs with
  a known numeric caller ID, for the purposes of matching our ! XLATE to permit
  the call through our call blocking construct.
